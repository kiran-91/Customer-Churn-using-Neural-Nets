# Customer-Churn-using-Neural-Networks

## A machine learning/Deep Learning project to predict customer churn using neural networks.

## This project aims to build a model that can accurately predict which customers are likely to churn. It leverages the power of neural networks, a type of machine learning algorithm, to analyze customer data and identify patterns that indicate churn.

## Key Technologies:

### Sklearn: It is a collection of tools that allow you to quickly build and deploy machine learning models
### TensorFlow&Keras: A popular open-source machine learning framework for building and training neural networks.
### TensorBoard: A visualization tool for understanding and debugging neural network training.
### Streamlit: A Python framework for building web applications, used to create a user interface for the model.
