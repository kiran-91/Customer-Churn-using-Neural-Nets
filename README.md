# Customer Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting customer churn using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The project includes a Streamlit web app that allows users to input customer data and predict whether the customer is likely to churn. The model is trained on historical customer data, preprocessed, and visualized using TensorBoard to track the learning process.

## Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling.
Artificial Neural Network: Built using TensorFlow/Keras for accurate churn predictions.
Model Training & Visualization: Monitor the model’s performance using TensorBoard.
Streamlit Web App: User-friendly interface for making real-time churn predictions based on user input.

## Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```cmd
git clone https://https://github.com/kiran-91/Customer-Churn-using-Neural-Nets.git
cd Customer-Churn-using-Neural-Nets
```

2. Setup a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
```cmd
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/MacOS
venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
```

3. Install required dependencies
```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the streamlit app
```cmd
streamlit run app.py
```

## Results 
If you're on Team Lazy like me and would rather skip all the tasks, no worries—just kick back and check out the Streamlit app right here!
